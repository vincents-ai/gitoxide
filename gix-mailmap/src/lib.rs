//! [Parse][parse()] .mailmap files as used in git repositories and remap names and emails
//! using an [accelerated data-structure][Snapshot].
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! ```
//! use gix_actor::SignatureRef;
//!
//! let input = b"
//! Joe R. Developer <joe@example.com> <bugs@example.com>
//! Jane Doe <jane@example.com> Jane <bugs@example.com>
//! ";
//!
//! let parsed = gix_mailmap::parse(input)
//!     .collect::<Result<Vec<_>, _>>()
//!     .unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(parsed.len(), 2);
//!
//! let snapshot = gix_mailmap::Snapshot::new(parsed);
//! let resolved = snapshot.resolve(
//!     SignatureRef::from_bytes(b"Jane <bugs@example.com> 1711398853 +0800").unwrap(),
//! );
//!
//! assert_eq!(resolved.name, "Jane Doe");
//! assert_eq!(resolved.email, "jane@example.com");
//! ```
