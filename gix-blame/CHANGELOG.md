## 0.12.0 (2026-04-24)

### Chore

 - <csr-id-3e05ca352597ef5966fa4dc4f52456c2424cddad/> add package.include directives to control which files are packaged.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-8094f5dcd4f24f4d54f7fbe7f716f80f2974b586/> Use `imara-diff-v2` with git sliders processing
   The slider post-processing imrpoves the diff quality for about 8% slower diffs.
   Line-counts, however, will be 50% faster to compute.

## 0.4.0 (2025-10-22)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-2230fde962a0832dd3f54d30da88eec8993f847e/> support multiple range formats in `BlameRanges`
   This modification introduces changes to the `BlameRanges` struct,
   converting it into an enum to support both `PartialFile` and
   `WholeFile`. Internally the ranges in `BlameRanges` are stored as
   zero-based exclusive ranges now.
 - <csr-id-7ecbec0fa235a719df2964a883607a9a20563af9/> rename range to ranges

## 0.3.0 (2025-07-15)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-81297cf2b85072ad13824f9821a0102dc6497f80/> add `debug_track_path` and `blame_path`
 - <csr-id-d2e98f3cf458121da3d23933d6a7421d70309a20/> follow renames in blame
 - <csr-id-f1890313c42d8f5b347feef1f48ec53f054dff08/> Add `BlameRanges` to enable multi-range blame support
   This update replaces single-range handling with the `BlameRanges` type, allowing multiple 1-based inclusive line ranges to be specified for blame operations.
   
   It hides some of the implementation details of the range logic, prepares for compatibility with `git` behavior, and adds tests to validate multi-range scenarios.

## v0.1.0 (2025-04-04)

<csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/>
<csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/> uniformize deny attributes
 - <csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/> remove default link to cargo doc everywhere

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-e14dc7d475373d2c266e84ff8f1826c68a34ab92/> note that crates have been renamed from `git-*` to `gix-*`.
   This also means that the `git-*` prefixed crates of the `gitoxide` project
   are effectively unmaintained.
   Use the crates with the `gix-*` prefix instead.
   
   If you were using `git-repository`, then `gix` is its substitute.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `git-features` and `git-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.
 - <csr-id-e9a493c204979d1a155c198331277662d26aec58/> add `diff_algorithm` to `blame::file()`
 - <csr-id-e08cf8811e25c91ca410963703ce98db32be3681/> add `since` to `blame::file()`
 - <csr-id-1250df3f9c10f66e4b8e227809831f3088482960/> skip uninteresting commits for blame
   This is breaking because it takes a commitgraph cache as argument
   , and because it replaces the `traverse` by `suspect`.
   
   Switch to date order for traversing the commit history, as opposed to
   topo order. This is also what `git blame` does.
   
   Skip suspects that have no associated unblamed hunks
   
   Pass blame to parent in `process_change`. `git`’s algorithm only seems
   to keep the current suspect for unblamed hunks that were the direct
   result of splitting an existing unblamed hunk because it matched with a
   change. All other hunks appear to be blamed on the parent without
   further checks.
   
   Add assertion that lines always match.

## v0.0.0 (2025-01-18)

<csr-id-17835bccb066bbc47cc137e8ec5d9fe7d5665af0/>
<csr-id-64ff0a77062d35add1a2dd422bb61075647d1a36/>

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-787cf6f5a838a96da49330c99a8530ac3206de50/> add `range` to `blame::file()`

### New Features

 - <csr-id-4ffe6eb8f7921c6a03db0aa6d796cc2e3cc328e0/> Add support for statistics and additional performance information.
 - <csr-id-25efbfb72e5a043ce8f7d196c1f7104ef93394df/> Add `blame` plumbing crate to the top-level.
   For now, it doesn't come with a simplified `gix` API though.
 - <csr-id-17835bccb066bbc47cc137e8ec5d9fe7d5665af0/> bump `rust-version` to 1.70
   That way clippy will allow to use the fantastic `Option::is_some_and()`
   and friends.
 - <csr-id-64ff0a77062d35add1a2dd422bb61075647d1a36/> Update gitoxide repository URLs

### Chore

 - <csr-id-17835bccb066bbc47cc137e8ec5d9fe7d5665af0/> bump `rust-version` to 1.70
   That way clippy will allow to use the fantastic `Option::is_some_and()`
   and friends.

### Other

 - <csr-id-64ff0a77062d35add1a2dd422bb61075647d1a36/> Update gitoxide repository URLs
   This updates `Byron/gitoxide` URLs to `GitoxideLabs/gitoxide` in:
   
   - Markdown documentation, except changelogs and other such files
     where such changes should not be made.
   
   - Documentation comments (in .rs files).
   
   - Manifest (.toml) files, for the value of the `repository` key.
   
   - The comments appearing at the top of a sample hook that contains
     a repository URL as an example.
   
   When making these changes, I also allowed my editor to remove
   trailing whitespace in any lines in files already being edited
   (since, in this case, there was no disadvantage to allowing this).
   
   The gitoxide repository URL changed when the repository was moved
   into the recently created GitHub organization `GitoxideLabs`, as
   detailed in #1406. Please note that, although I believe updating
   the URLs to their new canonical values is useful, this is not
   needed to fix any broken links, since `Byron/gitoxide` URLs
   redirect (and hopefully will always redirect) to the coresponding
   `GitoxideLabs/gitoxide` URLs.
   
   While this change should not break any URLs, some affected URLs
   were already broken. This updates them, but they are still broken.
   They will be fixed in a subsequent commit.
   
   This also does not update `Byron/gitoxide` URLs in test fixtures
   or test cases, nor in the `Makefile`. (It may make sense to change
   some of those too, but it is not really a documentation change.)
