## 0.19.0 (2025-04-25)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-38b63c2fc9d407b3c634d8b0c72d4d0c104aa5ad/> make `fs::walkdir_sorted_new()` sort entries by paths literally
   This follows up 7b1b5bf864e74706aefeb1213e8bdb0545d5464a. Since packed-refs
   appears to be sorted by full ref name, loose-refs should also be emitted in
   that order.
   
   The comparison function is copied from gix::diff::object::tree::EntryRef.
   Non-utf8 file names are simply mapped to "" on Windows. We could add some
   fallback, but callers can't handle such file names anyway.

## 0.15.0 (2024-10-22)

<csr-id-64ff0a77062d35add1a2dd422bb61075647d1a36/>

### Other

 - <csr-id-64ff0a77062d35add1a2dd422bb61075647d1a36/> Update gitoxide repository URLs
   This updates `Byron/gitoxide` URLs to `GitoxideLabs/gitoxide` in:
   
   - Markdown documentation, except changelogs and other such files
     where such changes should not be made.
   
   - Documentation comments (in .rs files).
   
   - Manifest (.toml) files, for the value of the `repository` key.
   
   - The comments appearing at the top of a sample hook that contains
     a repository URL as an example.
   
   When making these changes, I also allowed my editor to remove
   trailing whitespace in any lines in files already being edited
   (since, in this case, there was no disadvantage to allowing this).
   
   The gitoxide repository URL changed when the repository was moved
   into the recently created GitHub organization `GitoxideLabs`, as
   detailed in #1406. Please note that, although I believe updating
   the URLs to their new canonical values is useful, this is not
   needed to fix any broken links, since `Byron/gitoxide` URLs
   redirect (and hopefully will always redirect) to the coresponding
   `GitoxideLabs/gitoxide` URLs.
   
   While this change should not break any URLs, some affected URLs
   were already broken. This updates them, but they are still broken.
   They will be fixed in a subsequent commit.
   
   This also does not update `Byron/gitoxide` URLs in test fixtures
   or test cases, nor in the `Makefile`. (It may make sense to change
   some of those too, but it is not really a documentation change.)

## 0.7.1 (2023-12-30)

<csr-id-3bd09ef120945a9669321ea856db4079a5dab930/>

### Chore

- <csr-id-3bd09ef120945a9669321ea856db4079a5dab930/> change `rust-version` manifest field back to 1.65.
  They didn't actually need to be higher to work, and changing them
  unecessarily can break downstream CI.

  Let's keep this value as low as possible, and only increase it when
  more recent features are actually used.

## 0.3.0 (2023-09-08)

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-072ee32f693a31161cd6a843da6582d13efbb20b/> use `dyn` trait where possible.
   This reduces compile time due to avoiding duplication.
 - <csr-id-25c5bcebd4dbc4ac189d8af044ed0352c6188ce8/> `IsActivePlatform::is_active()` now only considers the URL in passed configuration
   Previously, it would consider the presence of `url` in the `.gitmodules` file as well, which is
   not the way git does it.

## 0.2.0 (2023-08-22)

<csr-id-229bd4899213f749a7cc124aa2b82a1368fba40f/>

### Chore

- <csr-id-229bd4899213f749a7cc124aa2b82a1368fba40f/> don't call crate 'WIP' in manifest anymore.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-af1cab31fd5ead445c988cce058c136c81229ad1/> TBD a way to learn if submodules are active efficiently

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-e0d9b09d02f88536b93ab6a31fddf9483881c5c1/> `Modules::is_active()` now counts everything that doesn't match `submodule.active` (if present) as inactive.
 - <csr-id-8172f0e0f19e84fdaedceb87399f3fab4a1eb563/> Assure `gix-submodule` works with Rust 1.65.
   The previous version of this loop, possibly preferable, ran into
   a borrow-check issue that was no more from Rust 1.70 onwards.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3503f4948b42854256c9e8d8336ebe222fee980b/> remove `File::names_and_active_state()` in favor of `File::is_active_platform()`.
   With this platform it's possible to make repeated checks to see if a named submodule is active.
 - <csr-id-4a443e453285095daccdca0fed9e8486ce7892ab/> make API less error prone by enforcing overrides at instantiation time.
   It's made so that overrides can still be applied at a later point.
