## 0.20.0 (2026-04-24)

### Documentation

 - <csr-id-b1102c24055bbf15987a6a8c2e66338aa8a56438/> add crate-root doctests

### New Features

 - <csr-id-915139f1b0d49bd9815ab24c41c08108934c6c28/> add WASI (wasm32-wasip2) platform support
   Add compilation support for the `wasm32-wasip2` target across four crates:

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-9197d68ca67817d3fe7d09678562ae6c511e817c/> make sure filesystem capability probing works in worktrees
   Previously it misdetected case-insensitive as case-sensitive,
   which is now fixed.
   
   Notable downside, which needs fixing on the caller side:
   
   `probe()` now treats a linked worktree admin dir as authoritative by
   checking `HEAD`, but `gix_discover::repository::Path::LinkedWorkTree`
   stores `git_dir` as `.git/worktrees/<name>` and keeps the actual checkout
   in a separate `work_dir` (`gix-discover/src/repository.rs:64-75,103-106`).
   When those live on different filesystems, this reports the main repository
   volume's case-folding instead of the worktree's, and downstream code
   such as checkout uses `options.fs.ignore_case` to build path caches
   (`gix-worktree-state/src/checkout/function.rs:64-67`). In practice, a linked
   worktree on a case-sensitive volume mounted from a case-insensitive main repo
   will now be misclassified as case-insensitive.

## 0.14.1 (2025-04-25)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-d139fa469cef4d2a2c351ba4c7f34a090a03c233/> `ToNormalPathComponent` now also validates the component if it's not a `Path`.
   Previously it was possible for strings or BString/BStr to contain non-normal
   components, now there is much more validation.
 - <csr-id-8624586f4d9df726afe1c6939b952e4241865571/> make `is_executable()` more permissive by taking the group and 'other' permissions into account.

## 0.14.0 (2025-04-04)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-d139fa469cef4d2a2c351ba4c7f34a090a03c233/> `ToNormalPathComponent` now also validates the component if it's not a `Path`.
   Previously it was possible for strings or BString/BStr to contain non-normal
   components, now there is much more validation.
 - <csr-id-8624586f4d9df726afe1c6939b952e4241865571/> make `is_executable()` more permissive by taking the group and 'other' permissions into account.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-f93aa6187d3b0d3d1eae193eae3de2e5af10b2d0/> add `FileSnapshot::into_owned_or_cloned()`.
   That way it's possible to efficiently take ownership if there happens to
   be only one instance of a snapshot.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-6c3608c78b3d6f3f4d1c90a5fbbf3096698c9ac5/> add `gix-fs::stack::ToNormalPathComponents`.

### New Features

   This makes it easier to portably identify IO errors, especially while
   the MSRV is not Rustc v1.83 which stabilizes the error kind variants.

## 0.12.0 (2024-10-22)

<csr-id-64ff0a77062d35add1a2dd422bb61075647d1a36/>

### Other

 - <csr-id-64ff0a77062d35add1a2dd422bb61075647d1a36/> Update gitoxide repository URLs
   This updates `Byron/gitoxide` URLs to `GitoxideLabs/gitoxide` in:
   
   - Markdown documentation, except changelogs and other such files
     where such changes should not be made.
   
   - Documentation comments (in .rs files).
   
   - Manifest (.toml) files, for the value of the `repository` key.
   
   - The comments appearing at the top of a sample hook that contains
     a repository URL as an example.
   
   When making these changes, I also allowed my editor to remove
   trailing whitespace in any lines in files already being edited
   (since, in this case, there was no disadvantage to allowing this).
   
   The gitoxide repository URL changed when the repository was moved
   into the recently created GitHub organization `GitoxideLabs`, as
   detailed in #1406. Please note that, although I believe updating
   the URLs to their new canonical values is useful, this is not
   needed to fix any broken links, since `Byron/gitoxide` URLs
   redirect (and hopefully will always redirect) to the coresponding
   `GitoxideLabs/gitoxide` URLs.
   
   While this change should not break any URLs, some affected URLs
   were already broken. This updates them, but they are still broken.
   They will be fixed in a subsequent commit.
   
   This also does not update `Byron/gitoxide` URLs in test fixtures
   or test cases, nor in the `Makefile`. (It may make sense to change
   some of those too, but it is not really a documentation change.)

## 0.11.2 (2024-07-23)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-1e81220824bd139db01a81de516eee7e0bc23715/> Always fall back to creating file symlinks on Windows
   When the metadata of a symlink's target cannot be obtained, even if
   the error is something other than `NotFound`, this falls back to
   creating file symbolic links. This only affects scenarios where
   either the checkout would fail entirely or where the symlink would
   have been treated as a collision and skipped (even though it was
   not really a collision, since only its target had an error). Other
   cases are not affected, and all exisitng scenarios where directory
   symlink would be created will still create directory symlinks.
   
   This builds on 31d02a8 (#1363) by supporting dangling symlinks even
   when the target filenames are unusual, such as when the name is
   invalid or reserved. Windows permits such symlinks to be created,
   and going ahead and creating the matches the Git behavior.
   
   This should also support other errors beisdes `NotFound`. For
   example, some permissions-related errors, in some cases where
   traversal or acccess (even to access metadata) are not allowed,
   would fail to create a symlink. This should address that as well.
   
   This works by using `Path::is_dir()` in the standard library, which
   automatically converts all errors (not just `NotFound`) into
   `false`. The logic here is thus quite similar to what was already
   present, just more tolerant, even though the code itself is shorter
   and simpler.
   
   This fixes #1420, and also fixes #1421.

## 0.11.0 (2024-05-22)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-bec648dc5790186cddbe12277978baf572f8e164/> multi-process safe parallel filesystem capabilities probing
   This is achieved by making filenames unique so they won't clash.
 - <csr-id-31d02a89ee15a0df463a5b5c34864497f8adfae1/> default to creating file-symlinks if it is dangling on Windows
   This behaviour is the same as in Git.

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-874cfd6dd7e371f178ec5f63368220b272608805/> validate all components pushed onto the stack when creating leading paths.
   This way, everyone using the stack with the purpose of
   altering the working tree will run additional checks to prevent callers
   from sneaking in forbidden paths.
   
   Note that these checks don't run otherwise, so one has to be careful
   to not forget to run these checks whenever needed.

   adjust the filepath automatically depending on the value of
   precompose_unicode

## 0.9.1 (2023-12-30)

<csr-id-3bd09ef120945a9669321ea856db4079a5dab930/>

### Chore

- <csr-id-3bd09ef120945a9669321ea856db4079a5dab930/> change `rust-version` manifest field back to 1.65.
  They didn't actually need to be higher to work, and changing them
  unecessarily can break downstream CI.

  Let's keep this value as low as possible, and only increase it when
  more recent features are actually used.
