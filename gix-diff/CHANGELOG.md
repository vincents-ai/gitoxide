## 0.62.0 (2026-04-24)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-8094f5dcd4f24f4d54f7fbe7f716f80f2974b586/> Use `imara-diff-v2` with git sliders processing
   The slider post-processing imrpoves the diff quality for about 8% slower diffs.
   Line-counts, however, will be 50% faster to compute.

## 0.60.0 (2026-02-22)

### Other

 - <csr-id-e63d487fb1b1425a9458fc7400517ad2c0280fd2/> skip subtrees with identical oids
   Add a short-circuit check to the core gix-diff algorithm to skip identical
   subtrees based on oid. This substantially improves diff performance on large
   repos by avoiding loading & diffing objects from unchanged subtrees.

## 0.54.0 (2025-10-22)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-e4eb98e2dc0d77d54e23b29113d0294e0e005553/> make non-UTF8 unified diffs possible again.
 - <csr-id-f4e630f3c6732144397b44763979a6e8f844872d/> compare symlinks with blobs as long as these aren't read from the worktree (without support)
 - <csr-id-ec26d3287f6b81daccf068d944966e216ea98d12/> textconf programs are now always run through a shell.
   This is based on what Git does, see https://github.com/git/git/commit/41a457e4f814a0e514548b3178e7692129f0fcfe .
   
   This originally surfaced in https://github.com/gitbutlerapp/gitbutler/issues/9540 .

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-0924bd30cbec5b47b604f159a1efee72032740a6/> add `DiffLineType` and `HunkHeader`
   This commit modifies the public API of `ConsumeHunk::consume_hunk` to
   use the new types `DiffLineType` and `HunkHeader`. It also shifts
   responsibility for adding newlines to the API's consumer.

## 0.53.0 (2025-07-15)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-bd0189360152325b3d0eb8a19a1c96af938071b1/> add explicit accessors for common fields
 - <csr-id-c84296b98876539e1b21072f32c0339932215f42/> Add `Sink` that implements git's diffing improvement heuristics

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-0d102f4bdf1450f9c5f8d4176707c73b499bd665/> `blob::UnifiedDiff` now produces non-overlapping hunks.
   Previously it was possible to see two hunks with overlapping context lines
   due to an off-by-one error.
 - <csr-id-4f271796041655d80ab0435a76281446e21ad8cd/> remove `blob::GitDiff` Sink as it doesn't work concistently.
   Against better judgement I was compelled to merge this implementation in,
   assuming one test must be enough given that it is a transcription.
   
   This, however, wasn't the case and there is strong evidence that it produces
   diffs that aren't correct.
 - <csr-id-0eaced934a4d52d80d680222fc0c9f7aae74f056/> improve rename tracking performance characteristics to make exponential runtime less likely.
   This optimizes specifically for the case where there are a lot of added files, but no deletion to
   pair it up with.

## 0.51.0 (2025-04-04)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-37582b089357ba9e06547374ea651c51d3608890/> add `blob::platform::Resource::intern_source_strip_newline_separators()`
   That way it will be easier to have typical Git-style patches diffs around
   files that don't end with a newline.
 - <csr-id-1ccbeef894e92d770ac0207d92b8e0f6686c3360/> add `blob::UnifiedDiff` as Sink to build unified diffs.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-807c2de44317cf4649684e0ce6ec26db8bea2136/> make `blob::Platform::filter_mode` public.
   There isn't a reason not to allow changes to this field.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-c70d912fabfa7bbda185bc390fb3ea304173e5dc/> blob diff resources and outcomes now inform about the usage of text-conv filters.
   This is needed to prevent applications from treating such buffers like user data.

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-1091e29c06a8682b761fe54bf18ae7e40121aa51/> `blob::UnifiedDiff::new(...newline...)` is now an Enum.
   That way one can specify where newlines should be added.

## 0.49.0 (2024-12-22)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-d281ba6b180d052aa6df43f43696a84819218d4d/> enforce `diff.renamelimit` even for identical name matching
   The problem here is that our implementation avoids using a hashmap,
   but pays the price by having bad performance if there are too many
   possible candidates (binary search doesn't seem to be up to the task).
   
   This can lead to impossibly long runtimes, so for now, limit it explicitly.

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-d3f5f27732ec5dfb496a3f9d0dd17a3a79d408f3/> add support for not tracking single empty files.
   Empty files are equivalent to having no content, which also means
   such files have no identity to speak off. This definitely helps
   with false positives of `.gitignore` for instance, which can be empty
   to tell Git to track a directory.
   
   On top of that, Git has a heuristic to do rename tracking of small files
   by similarity as the similarity may be off of files just have a couple of
   lines to speak about.
   
   Note that empty files that are renamed as part of a whole directory will still
   be tracked as renames.

## 0.48.0 (2024-11-24)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-5db2d2d8eef8570a42f9c040a7cdb341a71f7192/> add `tree_with_rewrites::Change(Ref)::source_mode_and_id|mode_and_id()`
 - <csr-id-cd61c25369d3e39b6160bac4b332b177dabddf4b/> octal Debug representation of `tree::EntryMode`.
   This makes it easier to reason about.
 - <csr-id-ba7b811bdfc8cba7b3622360749bfc4d927d974c/> support rename tracking across changed directories
 - <csr-id-674052002a781889d9b308ebd782f4f3cf5f41e8/> add traits for partial equality comparison to `tree_with_rewrites::Change` types
 - <csr-id-76e6762db493e10883b2dd332c7715e6f5524fd0/> add `tree_with_rewrites::Change(Ref)::previous_location()`
   That way, it's also possible to obtain the previous location in case of rewrites.
 - <csr-id-eb55c00be63960a7999978eef3f49d58bb10707c/> Allow access to `tree::State::buf1|2`.
   This allows to re-use that memory at least, making this kind of state a little more useful.
   Also, these fields can certainly be considered stable.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-e00e454ed6d6152d7926e4bd23e1bc2fcc628de0/> `tree()` diffing now also recognizes merge mode changes as modification.

## 0.47.0 (2024-10-22)

<csr-id-991c9391541d1a4ff3d3e135884139e706fa5f51/>
<csr-id-64ff0a77062d35add1a2dd422bb61075647d1a36/>
<csr-id-989276fa12cac8682fbcbdf52a945d41cb922a3f/>

### New Features

 - <csr-id-f2e813d8712f245f7f93ecae2a3da768dd6dc2db/> provide facilities to perform rewrite-tracking for tree-diffs in plumbing.
   This effectively pulls down a higher-level implementation in `gix` to the plumbing
   level, to allow it to be used there as well.
 - <csr-id-fe7ecd00c7c7091ea0225a5c437abeca85ce0dca/> Add `blob::pipeline::WorktreeRoots::is_unset()`
   That way it's easy to determine if a worktree root has any root set.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-53fa8abda6cf96e2afd8082db0d7a9f686d82752/> improve directory matching
   Previously the sorting wasn't accounted for, so an assumption about
   the order of changes weren't actually true.

### Other

 - <csr-id-991c9391541d1a4ff3d3e135884139e706fa5f51/> Update "cmp" links in `tree::function::diff`
   This updates the "git_cmp_c" and "git_cmp_rs" links in the
   `gix_diff::tree::function::diff` documentation comment.
   
   - The significant change is to the "git_cmp_rs" link (the second
     link), which accounts for how files have renamed and how code has
     been moved, and also changed in #849 to fix issue #848.
   
     This hyperlink change completes the third task listed in #1627.
   
   - The other change is to update the "git_cmp_c" link at the same
     time. That code has not changed, and this is just referring to a
     later commit (the current tip of the master branch in git/git).
   
     The reason to also do this change is to make it easier to verify,
     both now and for anyone reading the documentation, that that link
     remains current.
 - <csr-id-64ff0a77062d35add1a2dd422bb61075647d1a36/> Update gitoxide repository URLs
   This updates `Byron/gitoxide` URLs to `GitoxideLabs/gitoxide` in:
   
   - Markdown documentation, except changelogs and other such files
     where such changes should not be made.
   
   - Documentation comments (in .rs files).
   
   - Manifest (.toml) files, for the value of the `repository` key.
   
   - The comments appearing at the top of a sample hook that contains
     a repository URL as an example.
   
   When making these changes, I also allowed my editor to remove
   trailing whitespace in any lines in files already being edited
   (since, in this case, there was no disadvantage to allowing this).
   
   The gitoxide repository URL changed when the repository was moved
   into the recently created GitHub organization `GitoxideLabs`, as
   detailed in #1406. Please note that, although I believe updating
   the URLs to their new canonical values is useful, this is not
   needed to fix any broken links, since `Byron/gitoxide` URLs
   redirect (and hopefully will always redirect) to the coresponding
   `GitoxideLabs/gitoxide` URLs.
   
   While this change should not break any URLs, some affected URLs
   were already broken. This updates them, but they are still broken.
   They will be fixed in a subsequent commit.
   
   This also does not update `Byron/gitoxide` URLs in test fixtures
   or test cases, nor in the `Makefile`. (It may make sense to change
   some of those too, but it is not really a documentation change.)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-7be142d087a736339af54f2cb894edc7c36cdc90/> optional rename tracking for directories.
   Depending on the source of the rename-information, items that are children
   of renamed parents may be provided to enable rename tracking based on these
   containers, instead of always resorting to tracking leaf nodes (i.e. blobs).
 - <csr-id-cebef0bbfb6b64ce9c1a3ea3b8fd36e6121b1f1c/> better handling and tracking of directory renames
   Deletations that are caused by deletions higher up will now carry
   IDs to associate them with each other. This allows to bundle them
   at a later stage to re-obtain directory deletions.

### Refactor (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-989276fa12cac8682fbcbdf52a945d41cb922a3f/> add `tree()` function to diff a tree.
   Remove `tree::Changes()` and the ceremony required to diff a tree.

## 0.45.0 (2024-08-22)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-7f868d1e808656179a4c996ab586abceee952093/> add `blob::Platform::clear_resource_cache_keep_allocation()`.
   It allows to keep a free-list of buffers around after clearing, to help
   prevent re-allocating and growing bufers over and over.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-6990afd269c3461ae22e2821164c03a0dedc82f4/> similarity detection
   Previously it would incorrectly count only the last batch of removed bytes, and now it will count all of them. This leads to realistic results with complex diffs, even though it's probably still not en-par with Git which uses more complex heuristics.

## 0.39.1 (2023-12-30)

<csr-id-3bd09ef120945a9669321ea856db4079a5dab930/>

### Chore

- <csr-id-3bd09ef120945a9669321ea856db4079a5dab930/> change `rust-version` manifest field back to 1.65.
  They didn't actually need to be higher to work, and changing them
  unecessarily can break downstream CI.

  Let's keep this value as low as possible, and only increase it when
  more recent features are actually used.

## 0.38.0 (2023-12-06)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-ebe66dbc5720bb47a6c3810333060e17d6b58085/> add `blob::Platform` and `blob::Pipeline` for diff-content conversions and caching.
   The `Pipeline` provides ways to obtain content for use with a diffing algorithm,
   and the `Platform` is a way to cache such content to efficiently perform MxN matrix
   diffing, and possibly to prepare running external diff programs as well.
 - <csr-id-e2745fd20203bf26a30b563f2817e342df7c4742/> provider new rename-tracking faciliites.
   They generalize reneame tracking to the point where it can work for different
   kinds of changes.
   
   There is still some way to go until it is truly correct though, as it still
   lacks worktree conversions and diff filters.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-223278d31dbad6308b1c49d583fbfcd02846820e/> assure binary-detection also works if ODB files are below the big-file threshold.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-2637f8f7b169b3e0d925eee0c52c5cdb974f7411/> use `gix-object::Find` trait

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-feca5d0c1f56321d8fe15d59003195bf2f276c35/> rewrite-tracker now uses blob diff-platform for correct and optimized diffing.
   Correctness is improved as all necessary transformation are now performed.
   Performance is improved by avoiding duplicate work by caching transformed
   diffable data for later reuse.

## 0.29.0 (2023-04-26)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-b83ee366a3c65c717beb587ad809268f1c54b8ad/> Rename `serde1` cargo feature to `serde` and use the weak-deps cargo capability.
   With it it's possible to not automatically declare all optional dependencies externally visible
   features, and thus re-use feature names that oterwise are also a crate name.
   
   Previously I thought that `serde1` is for future-proofing and supporting multiple serde versions
   at the same time. However, it's most definitely a burden I wouldn't want anyway, so using
   `serde` seems to be the way to go into the future.

## 0.26.2 (2023-02-20)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-f0e40ecddaf1211f76ed60ef30cf03dcfd53a7ab/> add `wasm` feature toggle to allow compilation to wasm32-unknown-unknown
 - <csr-id-2ad0e8b984a874e0a591b01e9d46f2f24a541a97/> `tree::Recorder::track_location()` to track no location or filenames only.
   Previously the recorder would track full paths, but now it's possible to configure it
   to track no paths or file names only.
   
   That way it's possible to use the implementation in custom delegate implementations or
   otherwise tune the computational cost according to actual needs.
 - <csr-id-507196e63875100e705573f3b4aab110b7876852/> add `tree::visit::Change::(oid_and_mode|mode)()` methods.
   These methods allow to easily access the current object id and mode
   of a change, as well as the mode separately.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-e14dc7d475373d2c266e84ff8f1826c68a34ab92/> note that crates have been renamed from `git-*` to `gix-*`.
   This also means that the `git-*` prefixed crates of the `gitoxide` project
   are effectively unmaintained.
   Use the crates with the `gix-*` prefix instead.
   
   If you were using `git-repository`, then `gix` is its substitute.

## 0.26.1 (2023-02-17)

<csr-id-ebc7f47708a63c3df4415ba0e702660d976dfb3e/>
<csr-id-2290d006705ff47ad780b009fe58ee422b3285af/>

<csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/>

### Refactor (BREAKING)

- <csr-id-ebc7f47708a63c3df4415ba0e702660d976dfb3e/> remove pack-cache from `Find::try_find(…)`
  With the new architecture this can be an implementation detail without
  forcing it to be Sync.
- <csr-id-2290d006705ff47ad780b009fe58ee422b3285af/> move git_pack::data::Object to git_object::Data, massively alter git_odb::Find trait
  This will break a lot, but has to happen to prepare these traits for the
  next generation of object databases.

### Other (BREAKING)

- <csr-id-fed47d45b7e39958921a230b485b5b0384c8672f/> rename `lines` module to `text`.
  Thanks to `imara-diff`, diffs can easily abstract over different kinds
  of tokens, at the expense of a much more complex call signature.

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-6d9533dd987241fe0ddf0e401512ca6bdf0d3ff0/> Don't degenerate errors when accessing objects

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `git-features` and `git-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-16b553367518153b8f5b0bb6b23d2fcefcaac801/> re-export the `imara-diff` crate as `git_diff::blob::*`.
   It's flexible API needs nothing more and can be wrapped into more
   convenient APIs from higher-level crates.
   
   Note that despite being limited to `blob`, technically `imara-diff`
   can handle diffing any kind of sequence.
 - <csr-id-68a336502351ce16b804e7c099479bc974c3787c/> remove `text::with(…)` as it's not usable in practice.
   The only viable API for now, and not a bad one at that, is the one
   `imara-diff` provides.
 - <csr-id-ee26ddfe645ca39024795f85bb8e1cab6b6f5863/> replace `similar` with `imara-diff`.
   The latter clearly has a more complex call signature, but that also
   makes it far more powerful which will pay off with better performance.
 - <csr-id-8c5ae77f06a64c57df9a9ad1190266896a223dbe/> Remove deprecated compound and linked object databases
   The dynamic/general store is the only maintained can-do-it-all
   DB now.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-f0e40ecddaf1211f76ed60ef30cf03dcfd53a7ab/> add `wasm` feature toggle to allow compilation to wasm32-unknown-unknown
 - <csr-id-e164856ab8d80c13b082a283b4c73b6fb31968f6/> forward line-diffing capabilities curtesy of the `similar` crate.
   This is a first and maybe the last step towards providing diffing
   functionality, and it seems like the right choice to keep this in
   similar and contribute there as needed. All algorithms are well
   described and thus shouldn't be git-specific per-se, and `similar`
   is the best the community has to offer.

### Chore

- <csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/> uniformize deny attributes
- <csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/> remove default link to cargo doc everywhere

### Documentation

 - <csr-id-39ed9eda62b7718d5109135e5ad406fb1fe2978c/> fix typos

## 0.26.0 (2023-01-09)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.25.0 (2022-12-30)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.24.0 (2022-12-19)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.23.0 (2022-11-21)

### New Features (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-3d8fa8fef9800b1576beab8a5bc39b821157a5ed/> upgrade edition to 2021 in most crates.
   MSRV for this is 1.56, and we are now at 1.60 so should be compatible.
   This isn't more than a patch release as it should break nobody
   who is adhering to the MSRV, but let's be careful and mark it
   breaking.
   
   Note that `gix-features` and `gix-pack` are still on edition 2018
   as they make use of a workaround to support (safe) mutable access
   to non-overlapping entries in a slice which doesn't work anymore
   in edition 2021.

## 0.22.0 (2022-11-08)

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-16b553367518153b8f5b0bb6b23d2fcefcaac801/> re-export the `imara-diff` crate as `gix_diff::blob::*`.
   It's flexible API needs nothing more and can be wrapped into more
   convenient APIs from higher-level crates.
   
   Note that despite being limited to `blob`, technically `imara-diff`
   can handle diffing any kind of sequence.
 - <csr-id-68a336502351ce16b804e7c099479bc974c3787c/> remove `text::with(…)` as it's not usable in practice.
   The only viable API for now, and not a bad one at that, is the one
   `imara-diff` provides.

## 0.21.0 (2022-11-06)

<csr-id-fed47d45b7e39958921a230b485b5b0384c8672f/>

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-ee26ddfe645ca39024795f85bb8e1cab6b6f5863/> replace `similar` with `imara-diff`.
   The latter clearly has a more complex call signature, but that also
   makes it far more powerful which will pay off with better performance.

### Other (BREAKING)

- <csr-id-fed47d45b7e39958921a230b485b5b0384c8672f/> rename `lines` module to `text`.
  Thanks to `imara-diff`, diffs can easily abstract over different kinds
  of tokens, at the expense of a much more complex call signature.

## 0.20.0 (2022-10-10)

Maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.19.0 (2022-09-20)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-e164856ab8d80c13b082a283b4c73b6fb31968f6/> forward line-diffing capabilities curtesy of the `similar` crate.
   This is a first and maybe the last step towards providing diffing
   functionality, and it seems like the right choice to keep this in
   similar and contribute there as needed. All algorithms are well
   described and thus shouldn't be git-specific per-se, and `similar`
   is the best the community has to offer.

## 0.18.1 (2022-09-01)

Maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.18.0 (2022-08-28)

### Bug Fixes (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-6d9533dd987241fe0ddf0e401512ca6bdf0d3ff0/> Don't degenerate errors when accessing objects

## 0.17.2 (2022-08-24)

<csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/>
<csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/>

### Chore

- <csr-id-f7f136dbe4f86e7dee1d54835c420ec07c96cd78/> uniformize deny attributes
- <csr-id-533e887e80c5f7ede8392884562e1c5ba56fb9a8/> remove default link to cargo doc everywhere

## 0.17.1 (2022-08-17)

A maintenance release without user facing changes.

## 0.17.0 (2022-07-22)

This is a maintenance release with no functional changes.

## 0.16.0 (2022-05-18)

A maintenance release without user-facing changes.

## 0.15.0 (2022-04-05)

### Changed (BREAKING)

 - <csr-id-8c5ae77f06a64c57df9a9ad1190266896a223dbe/> Remove deprecated compound and linked object databases
   The dynamic/general store is the only maintained can-do-it-all
   DB now.

## 0.14.0 (2022-04-03)

A maintenance release primarily to adapt to dependent crates.

## 0.13.0 (2022-01-23)

<csr-id-ebc7f47708a63c3df4415ba0e702660d976dfb3e/>
<csr-id-2290d006705ff47ad780b009fe58ee422b3285af/>

### Changes (BREAKING)

- remove pack-cache from `Find::try_find(…)`
  With the new architecture this can be an implementation detail without
  forcing it to be Sync.
- move gix_pack::data::Object to gix_object::Data, massively alter gix_odb::Find trait
  This will break a lot, but has to happen to prepare these traits for the
  next generation of object databases.

## 0.12.0 (2021-11-29)

A maintenance release, triggered by putting too many adjustments into a single commit.

## 0.11.1 (2021-11-16)

A maintenance release triggered by changes to gix-pack and changelog rewrites.

## v0.11.0 (2021-10-19)

A maintenance release due to properly dealing with previously breaking changes in `gix-hash`.

## v0.10.0 (2021-10-15)

It looks like there were no functional changes despite the minor version bump.
Please consider it a fluke that will be fixed with `cargo smart-release` automating
version number generation.
