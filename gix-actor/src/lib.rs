//! This crate provides ways of identifying an actor within the git repository both in shared and mutable variants.
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! ```
//! use gix_actor::{IdentityRef, SignatureRef};
//!
//! let actor = IdentityRef::from_bytes(b" Taylor Example < taylor@example.com >")
//!     .unwrap()
//!     .trim();
//! assert_eq!(actor.name, "Taylor Example");
//! assert_eq!(actor.email, "taylor@example.com");
//!
//! let signature = SignatureRef::from_bytes(b"Taylor Example <taylor@example.com> 1711398853 +0800")
//!     .unwrap()
//!     .trim();
//! assert_eq!(signature.actor(), actor);
//!
//! let time = signature.time().unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(time.seconds, 1_711_398_853);
//! assert_eq!(time.offset, 8 * 60 * 60);
//!
//! let owned = signature.to_owned().unwrap();
//! let mut out = Vec::new();
//! owned.write_to(&mut out).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(out, b"Taylor Example <taylor@example.com> 1711398853 +0800");
//! ```
